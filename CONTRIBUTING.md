# Contributing
Thank you so much for your interest in contributing!. All types of contributions are encouraged and valued. See below for different ways to help, and details about how this project handles them!

Please make sure to read the relevant section before making your contribution! It will make it a lot easier for us maintainers to make the most of it and smooth out the experience for all involved. üíô

The Project Team looks forward to your contributions.

## Request a Feature

If the project doesn't do something you need or want it to do:

* Open an Issue at https://github.com/canopas/group-track-android/issues
* Provide as much context as you can about what you're running into.
* Please try and be clear about why existing features and alternatives would not work for you.

Once it's filed:

* The project team will [label the issue](#label-issues).
* The project team will evaluate the feature request, possibly asking you more questions to understand its purpose and any relevant requirements. If the issue is closed, the team will convey their reasoning and suggest an alternative path forward.
* If the feature request is accepted, it will be marked for implementation with `feature-accepted`, which can then be done by either by a core team member or by anyone in the community who wants to [contribute code](#contribute-code).

Note: The team is unlikely to be able to accept every single feature request that is filed. Please understand if they need to say no.


## Report an Error or Bug

If you run into an error or bug with the project:

* Open an Issue at https://github.com/canopas/group-track-android/issues
* Include *reproduction steps* that someone else can follow to recreate the bug or error on their own.
* Please be ready to provide that information if maintainers ask for it.

Once it's filed:

* The project team will [label the issue](#label-issues).
* A team member will try to reproduce the issue with your provided steps. If there are no repro steps or no obvious way to reproduce the issue, the team will ask you for those steps and mark the issue as `needs-repro`. Bugs with the `needs-repro` tag will not be addressed until they are reproduced.
* If the team is able to reproduce the issue, it will be marked `needs-fix`, as well as possibly other tags (such as `critical`).
* If you or the maintainers don't respond to an issue for 30 days, the [issue will be closed](#clean-up-issues-and-prs). If you want to come back to it, reply (once, please), and we'll reopen the existing issue. Please avoid filing new issues as extensions of one you already made.
* `critical` issues may be left open, depending on perceived immediacy and severity, even past the 30 day deadline.

 ## Request Support

If you have a question about this project, how to use it, or just need clarification about something:

* Open an Issue at https://github.com/canopas/group-track-android/issues

* Please be ready to provide that information if maintainers ask for it.

Once it's filed:

* The project team will [label the issue](#label-issues).
* Someone will try to have a response soon.
* If you or the maintainers don't respond to an issue for 30 days, the [issue will be closed](#clean-up-issues-and-prs). If you want to come back to it, reply (once, please), and we'll reopen the existing issue. Please avoid filing new issues as extensions of one you already made.

## Project Setup

So you wanna contribute some code! That's great! This project uses GitHub Pull Requests to manage contributions, so [read up on how to fork a GitHub project and file a PR](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking) if you've never done it before.

If this seems like a lot or you aren't able to do all this setup, you might also be able to [edit the files directly](https://help.github.com/articles/editing-files-in-another-user-s-repository/) without having to do any of this setup. Yes, [even code](#contribute-code).

Follow the [requirements](https://github.com/canopas/group-track-android?tab=readme-ov-file#requirements) to run the project and you should be ready to go!
