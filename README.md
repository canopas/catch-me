# Requirements
Make sure you have the latest stable version of Android Studio installed.
You can then proceed by either cloning this repository or importing the project directly into Android Studio, following the steps provided in the [documentation](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose/setup#sample).

### Google Maps SDK
To enable the MapView functionality, obtaining an API key as instructed in the [documentation](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/android-sdk/get-api-key) is required. This key should then be included in the local.properties file as follows:

```
MAPS_API_KEY=your_map_api_key
```

### Firebase Setup
To enable Firebase services, you will need to create a new project in the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
Use the `applicationId` value specified in the `app/build.gradle` file of the app as the Android package name.
Once the project is created, you will need to add the `google-services.json` file to the app module.
For more information, refer to the [Firebase documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/android/setup).

YourSpace uses the following Firebase services, Make sure you enable them in your Firebase project:
- Authentication (Phone, Google)
- Firestore (To store user data)
